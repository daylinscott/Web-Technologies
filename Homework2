#Downloading Experience
##Daylin Scott
This week has been a little bit of a struggle for me, I managed my time poorly in the beginning of last week. I thought that since it was so easy to download Visual Studio
onto my mac that downloading the rest of the programs would be the same as soon as I freed up the space on my computer for it. However, once I got into it I realized it was
much more complicate than that. I downloaded docker after googling how to run software made for Windows on a mac computer, but ran into trouble when I had to typw things into the
terminal in relation to docker. After zooming with you in the morning, we reconviened in the afternoon and you showed me virtual box, as a way to be able to run Windows 10 through 
my mac, and therefore, download the SQL microsoft programs. I am still having some trouble in figuring out how to run Windows 10 through Virtual box, but will keep trying tonight
and hopefully have it figured out by class tomorrow.
